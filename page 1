    <h2>Diet</h2>
      <p>The historic range of the gray wolf covered over two-thirds of the United States. Today gray wolves have populations in Alaska, northern Michigan, northern Wisconsin, western Montana, northern Idaho, northeast Oregon, and the Yellowstone area of Wyoming. Mexican wolves, a subspecies of the gray wolf, were reintroduced to protected parkland in eastern Arizona and southwest New Mexico. Wolves can thrive in a diversity of habitats from the tundra to woodlands, forests, grasslands and deserts.</p>
      <p>One of the most odd part of the diet of wolves is fish! Biologist Bod Bromley once observed a wolf in Canada's Northwest Territories catch five fish in fifteen minutes in the Talston River.</p>
      <p>Wolves will also eat wild berries and other fruit as a minor part of their diet.</p>
